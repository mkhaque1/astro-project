        Commission.
      </p>

      <h2>Relationship with Custom Website</h2>
      <p>
        Our Services are hosted on a custom website that processes your data to

        outside your country. The custom website acts as a data processor under

      <h2>Third Party Websites and Links</h2>

        collected, contact us to request deletion.
      </p>

      <h2>Security and Retention</h2>
      <p>
        While we use security measures, no system is infallible. Data is
        retained as long as necessary for the purposes outlined, or as required
        by law (e.g., 6 years for financial records under German law), after
        which it is securely deleted.
